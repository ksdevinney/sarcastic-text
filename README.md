## wHaT???

This is a simple application to transform text into aLtErNaTiNg case. 

## wHy??

For years, every internet forum user has lamented the lack of a "sarcasm font," until recently. Now, we understand that the use of alternating case denotes sarcasm. Unfortunately, it can drastically slow down your typing speed. The Sarcastic Text Generator will turn a string of text into something that is clearly sarcastic- so you don't have to do it yourself.

Yes, there are other services on the internet that can do this for you. However, I wanted to create my own application to do this, to practice using JavaScript. I also wanted to develop an application using a new CSS framework- I chose Ukit for its simplicity.

## hOw???

My application takes an input string, converts it to lower case, and uses the index of each letter in the string to capitalize (or not). Numbers, spaces, and other special characters will be unchanged. Another feature I would like to implement is the ability to copy the new text with a button click, instead of highlighting the whole thing.

This application is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://ksdevinney.github.io/sarcastic-text/). gO On, TrY It!
